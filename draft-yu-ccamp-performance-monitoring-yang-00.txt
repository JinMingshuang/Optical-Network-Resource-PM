1.  Introduction

   Performance monitoring is a basic function of optical networks
   management.  With it, operators can proactively detect the running
   state of devices, identify major risks in advanced and avoid users'
   complaints.

   As before, TMF has defined interfaces for performance management
   through traditional protocols, such as CORBA and MTOSI.  With the
   development of SDN technologies and the using of RESTCONF interfaces,
   it becomes a widespread requirement to use RESTCONF protocol to
   support performance monitoring.

Internet-Draft         Performance Monitoring YANG            March 2023


   Using RESTCONF does not mean changing existing performance monitoring
   requirements or scenarios.  On the contrary, since O&M is very
   important, many operators' O&M departments tend to be conservative.
   Mostly, they are fear of introducing issues into their network due to
   the protocol changes and O&M habits changes.  Therefore, our document
   prefers to use the new protocol to support legacy functionality.

   Traditional performance management involves control of performance
   monitoring, setting collectors on monitored objects, and obtaining
   performance data in different periods.  The data can be current data
   on devices or processed by PNC, and historical performance data.  TCA
   can be also configured by performance monitoring tasks.

   The explanation of performance monitoring indicator would also be an
   important part of this document, especially some typical optical-
   specific indicators.

   Currently, there are some existing documents related to performance
   monitoring in IETF, but there is no overlap with our current work.
   For example:

   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-pm-telemetry-autonomics] provides a YANG data
   model that describes performance monitoring and scaling intent
   mechanisms for TE-Tunnels and Virtual Networks(VNs).  VN is
   determinated to be used in CMI (CNC-MDSC Interface) level and TE
   tunnel is more service or connection related.  Our data model is
   proposed to be used in MPI (MDSC-PNC Interface) level and this
   performance monitoring is performed on network resources, such as
   network element, board, fiber, port or TTP (Tunnel Termination
   Point), which are not included in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-pm-telemetry-autonomics].

   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-yang-vpn-service-pm] defines a YANG data model for
   performance monitoring of both network topology layer and overlay VPN
   service topology layer.  VPN service is more IP-specific and not
   adopted in Optical domain.  And the data model in this document is
   augmenting network model.  If the client wants to retrieve
   performance data of a link by RESTCONF, the URL would be probably
   same with the URL of topology retrieval.  This may need some special
   mechanisms to make the client and server differentiate the using
   scenarios.  This is not quite compliance with current O&M habits of
   Optical technology.

   [I-D.zheng-ccamp-client-pm-yang] provides a performance monitoring
   YANG data model on client signal level.  It is also not operated on
   resource level which is not compliance with the existing O&M habits.
   This performance monitoring solution is more user-oriented and can be
   used for more automatic O&M scenarios in the future.  However, there

   is not a complete closed-loop O&M solution at the service layer and
   it has not been accepted by all operators' O&M departments, resource-
   based performance monitoring is still required.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

2.  YANG Data Model for Optical Performance Monitoring

   According to the business requirements stated in [TMF-518], resource
   performance management requirements include: * The Interface shall
   support the control of performance monitoring in the network.  This
   includes PM control, e.g., the enabling and disabling of PM
   collection and Threshold Crossing Alerts (TCA) control, e.g., the
   enabling and disabling of TCA generation. * The Interface shall
   support the retrieval of current and historical performance
   measurements for network resources. * The Interface shall support the
   distribution of TCAs to subscribed OSs.

   For these requirements of PM, there are three group of interfaces are
   defined in TMF, including PerformanceManagementControl,
   PerformanceManagementRetrieval and ThresholdCrossingAlertControlm.

2.1.  Performance Management Control

   There are three interfaces defined in TMF for this group, including:
   * clearPerformanceMonitoringData: This interface shall allow MDSC to
   clear or reset the performance register on TPs or NEs.  This clearing
   operation means to reset the data value to the current value.  The
   monitoring job is still running on. *
   disablePerformanceMonitoringData: This interface shall allow MDSC
   disable PM data collection on a list of TPs or NEs. *
   enablePerformanceMonitoringData: This interface shall allow MDSC
   enable PM data collection on a list of TPs or NEs.

   This aspect of interface we introduce a monitor task to do this
   control.  In the monitoring task, MDSC should be able to configure
   what period and what kind of performance data it want to collect.
   The disabling, enabling operation can be satisfy by changing the
   admin status which includes disabled, enabled.  The change's result
   will affect the task status accordingly.

         |              +--rw indicator-value-unit?   string

2.2.  PerformanceManagementRetrieval

   There are six interfaces are defined in TMF for this group,
   including: * getAllCurrentPerformanceMonitoringData: This interface
   should allow MDSC to retrieve performance data on a series of
   termination point. * getHistoryPerformanceMonitoringData: This
   interface should allow MDSC to retrieve some historic performance
   data on a series of termination point in a time period through FTP. *
   getAllPerformanceMonitoringPoints: This interface should allow MDSC
   to retrieve all the performance monitoring points in a specified
   termination point or NE. * getHoldingTime: This interface should
   allow MDSC to retrieve how many hours PM data records are held in
   PNC. * getMePerformanceMonitoringCapabilities: This interface should
   allow MDSC to retrieve what parameters are supported by a specified
   NE or termination point.

   For the retrieval of current/historic performance data, there is one
   option that we define the value in the data model.  But considered
   that performance data is frequently changed and if we follow that
   approach, according to the requirement of on-change notification in
   YANG-push [RFC8641], once the performance data changes, the PNC
   should trigger a notifcation to the MDSC, for the sake of data
   consistency.  But these two retrieval interfaces is more like on-
   demand invoking.  The interaction through notification would bring
   great pressure to both PNC and MDSC.

   And it is also hard to support retrieving performance data of
   multiple resources by data model.  And for historic performance data
   retrieval, there could be a requirement to specify the start time and
   end time.  It is not quite flexible to support this requirement by
   data model neither.

   So we suggest to define two RPCs to accomplish these two interfaces'
   function.

                        +--ro indicator-value-unit?   string

   //NOTE: To be futhur analyze: getAllPerformanceMonitoringPoints,
   getHoldingTime, getMePerformanceMonitoringCapabilities

2.3.  Threshold Crossing Alert Control

   There are nine interfaces are defined in TMF for this group,
   including: * createTcaParameterProfile: This interface should allow
   MDSC to create a new TCA parameter profile.  This profile can be
   applied to the resources. * deleteTcaParameterProfile: This interface
   should allow MDSC to delete an existing TCA parameter profile which
   should not have been used by any resources. *
   enableThresholdCrossingAlert: This interface should allow MDSC to
   turn on TCA reporting on a list of TPs and NEs if the reporting was

Internet-Draft         Performance Monitoring YANG            March 2023


   turned off before. * disableThresholdCrossingAlert: This interface
   should allow MDSC to turn off TCA reporting on a list of TPs and NEs.
   * getAllTcaParameterProfiles: This interfaces should allow MDSC to
   retrieve all TCA parameter profile that are being managed by a
   specified NE. * getTcaParameterProfile: This interface should allow
   MDSC to retrieve all the parameters of a specified TCA parameter
   profile. * getTcaTpParameter: This interface should allow MDSC to
   retrieve the PM threshold values on a TP. * setTcaParameterProfile:
   This interface should allow MDSC to configure all threshold values of
   a TCA parameter profile. * setTcaTpParameter: This interface should
   allow MDSC to modify the values of TCA Parameters on a TP

   To be summarized, there are four main requirements for Threshold
   Crossing Alert Control: * Creation/retrieval/deletion/updating of TCA
   profile; * Enabling/disabling TCA reporting on the resource; *
   Configuring TCA on the resource by associating an existing profile; *
   Configuring TCA on the resource by detailed parameters.

   And for the TCA parameters, no matter it is configured directly on
   the resource or by a preset profile, there should not be any
   differences.  The TCA parameter (indicator) should include: *
   indicator-name: Name of indicator.  This indicator should also
   include some data processing information, such if it is a maximum, or
   minimum, or average data .etc. * threshold-type: This threshold type
   is used to indicate when the alert will be triggered.  By exceeding
   the upper bound value, or by below the lower bound value. * period:
   This period is used to indicate the frequency of the data collection.
   * severity: This severity is used to indicate what level of alert
   would be triggered if cross the threshold. * indicator-value: The
   value of threshold. * indicator-value-unit: The unit of threshold
   value.

   The tree structure for TCA profile:

   The function of enabling/disabling TCA on the resource can be
   controlled by an admin-status attributes in "tca" node:

2.4.  Generic Resource

   The definition of most performance monitoring interfaces in TMF is
   quite generic.  And it is also similar that the functionalities of
   both alarm and performance monitoring can be defined with a generic
   structure, regardless of what kind of object is operated on.
   Therefore, our data model prefer to follow this approach.  And when
   defining our data model, we get refer to [RFC8632], in which a
   generic alarm data model is provided.  In [RFC8632], a union type of
   resource attributes is defined as the source of alarm.  So we also

   reference this structure in our data model.

   Additionally, we extend a resource-type attribute to indicate what
   exact kind of resource is.  Firstly, this attribute can help to
   improve interaction efficiency between PNC and MDSC.  The MDSC may
   quickly identify the resource type from this attribute, without
   parsing the resource identifier or searching the resource id in the
   whole resource.  On the other hand, it will be unified with the
   existing IETF topology and inventory objects and form a complete
   interface system.

7.  Manageability Considerations

   <Add any manageability considerations>

8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  Considerations in Section 8 of
   [RFC8795]are also applicable to their subtrees in the module defined
   in this document.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Considerations in Section 8 of
   [RFC8795] are also applicable to their subtrees in the module defined
   in this document.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers following YANG modules in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC6020].
